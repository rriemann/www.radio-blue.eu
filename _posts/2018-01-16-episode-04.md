  Panning in the 21st century for coins and waste. The new gold is now virtual and our old plastic is in the ocean. Shouldn't it be the other way around? For this episode, we met Marina from the sustainability subcommittee to talk about upcoming zero-waste events, and two founders of a Brussels-based organisation promoting Bitcoin to talk about Bitcoin.
